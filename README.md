2D Explicit CFD solver for incompressible laminar flow using finite difference and projection method. The Jupyter notebook in this repository contains seperate functions 
for the Advection, Diffusion, and Pressure terms as well as a general solver combining the three terms to provide computational solution to 2D incompressible Navier Stokes
for the provided initial and boundary conditions. The notebook also contains a solution to the lid-driven cavity problem for a Reynolds number of 50.
